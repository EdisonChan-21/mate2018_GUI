# iControl
Since the “Pixhawk” system only provides the basic control of the ROV, we have developed a new user-friendly and cross-platform GUI based on JavaScript and HTML, named iControl as shown in Figure 17. It provides Web Socket and Serial connection between our control panel and Raspberry Pi. Also, it presents OBS Wi-Fi data, seismograph and computer vision image. Formerly Node-Webkit (NW.js) framework is adopted because it can be implemented directly from DOM and enables an efficient way of writing Windows desktop application with all Web technologies such as HTML5, CSS and JQuery. Compared to last year Python-based GUI, iControl offers a better utilization of asynchronous function which maximizes the stability of network connection. Since iControl is independent of the whole control system, the changes and commands in “Pixhawk” or iControl will not affect each other.  Besides, iControl requires less computing power and is able to be implemented on multiple operating systems. 

Apart from providing efficient communication among the control system, iControl provides some special features that assist the co-pilot in completing the missions. Timer reminds the co-pilot to achieve time management during the product demonstration. A virtual panel provides a backup solution if the control panel malfunctions. The navigation bar shows the current connection status and condition. The flowchart of system software and block diagram are given in Figure 18 and 19 respectively.
